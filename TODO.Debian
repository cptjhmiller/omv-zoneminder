## Separate substantial /usr/share into its own arch-all package.

## Decide how to handle database updates.

  * Consider possibility that database may be on another machine (#469239).
  * Consider dbconfig-common? Probably not (what if database is not on localhost?).

### Run `zmupdate.pl` from service control scripts (init.d, service) on start?

 Automatic upgrade will break "one DB, many zoneminders" setup (unimportant?).
