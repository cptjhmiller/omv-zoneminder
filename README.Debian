Zoneminder for Debian
---------------------

Initializing database
---------------------

    pv /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf
OR
    cat /usr/share/zoneminder/db/zm_create.sql | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf

    echo 'grant lock tables, alter,select,insert,update,delete on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by "zmpass";'\
    | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf mysql

Hint: generate secure password with `pwgen` and update "/etc/zm/zm.conf"
accordingly.


Upgrading database
------------------

Prior to 1.28.1 database upgrade was performed automatically.
"zoneminder" service will refuse to start with outdated database.

Assuming that database is on "localhost" then the following command can be
used to upgrade "zm" database:

    zmupdate.pl

Additional permissions may be required to perform upgrade:

    echo 'grant lock tables, create, alter on zm.* to 'zmuser'@localhost identified by "zmpass";'\
    | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf mysql

The following command prints the current version of zoneminder database:

    echo 'select Value from Config where Name = "ZM_DYN_CURR_VERSION";' \
    | sudo mysql --defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf --skip-column-names zm


Enabling service
----------------

By default Zoneminder service is not starting automatically and need to be
manually activated once database is configured:

On systemd:

    sudo systemctl enable zoneminder.service

On SysV:

    sudo update-rc.d zoneminder enable


Web server set-up
-----------------

There are few manual steps to get the web interface working:

## Apache2

Apache can be configured as folder "/zm" using sample .conf:

    sudo a2enconf zoneminder

Alternatively Apache web site configuration template can be used to setup
zoneminder as "http://zoneminder":

    sudo cp -v /usr/share/doc/zoneminder/examples/apache.conf /etc/apache2/sites-available/
    sudo a2ensite zoneminder.conf

Common configuration steps for Apache2:

    sudo a2enmod cgi
    sudo service apache2 reload


## nginx

Nginx needs "php5-fpm" package to support PHP and "fcgiwrap" package
for binary "cgi-bin" applications:

    sudo apt-get install php5-fpm fcgiwrap

To enable a URL alias that makes Zoneminder available from

    http://yourserver/zm

the following line is to be added to "server" section of a web site
configuration:

    include /usr/share/doc/zoneminder/examples/nginx.conf;

For "default" web site it would be sufficient to include the above
statement to the file

    /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

## Note:

When Zoneminder web site is running it may be necessary to set PATH_ZMS to
"/zm/cgi-bin/nph-zms" in Options/Paths according to chosen web site
configuration.


Changing the location for images and events
-------------------------------------------

Zoneminder, in its upstream form, stores data in /usr/share/zoneminder/.  This
package modifies that by changing /usr/share/zoneminder/images and
/usr/share/zoneminder/events to symlinks to directories under
/var/cache/zoneminder.

There are numerous places these could be put and ways to do it.  But, at the
moment, if you change this, an upgrade will fail with a warning about these
locations having changed (the reason for this was that previously, an  upgrade
would silently revert the changes and cause event loss - refer
bug #608793).

If you do want to change the location, here are a couple of suggestions.
(thanks to vagrant@freegeek.org):

These lines in fstab could allow you to bind-mount an alternate location

         /dev/sdX1 /otherdrive ext3 defaults 0 2
         /otherdrive/zoneminder/images /var/cache/zoneminder/images bind defaults 0 2
         /otherdrive/zoneminder/events /var/cache/zoneminder/events bind defaults 0 2

        or if you have a separate partition for each:

         /dev/sdX1 /var/cache/zoneminder/images ext3 defaults 0 2
         /dev/sdX2 /var/cache/zoneminder/events ext3 defaults 0 2

Access to /dev/video*
---------------------

For cameras which require access to /dev/video*, zoneminder may need the
www-data user added to the video group in order to see those cameras:

  adduser www-data video

Note that all web applications running on the zoneminder server will then have
access to all video devices on the system.
